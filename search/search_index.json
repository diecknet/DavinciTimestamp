Overview You can add markers in your Davinci Resolve Timeline - but there is no native way to export these in a YouTube-compatible format. This PowerShell module helps by converting .edl files from Davinci Resolve to usable Timestamps. Installation The PowerShell module is available via the PowerShell Gallery . It should work with Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.x on Linux, macOS or Windows. # Windows PowerShell Install-Module DavinciTimestamp or # PowerShell 7.x Install-PSResource DavinciTimestamp How to use Text instructions In Davinci Resolve on the \"Edit\" page: Right-click on your active Timeline in the Media Pool. Click on Timelines -> Export -> Timeline Markers to EDL and save the file somewhere. [!WARNING] Do not use the Export option AAF / XML / EDL / DRT / OTIO... . Even though you can create .edl files with that option too, they're a bit different and are not supported with this module. Then in PowerShell run Get-EDLTimestamp -Path <PathToYourFile> . For example, if your .edl file was exported to C:\\temp\\MyTimeline.edl, run this: Get-EDLTimestamp -Path C:\\temp\\MyTimeline.edl [!TIP] Get-EDLTimestamp will try to automatically find a .edl file if you don't specify one. The cmdlet looks in your $HOME directory and /tmp (Linux/macOS) or C:\\temp (Windows). It will just take the first .edl file it finds though. Video instructions There are also Video instructions available on YouTube. German video English video Open Source! If you find any bugs or have feature requests, please open a ISSUE here in the GitHub repository. But I can't promise that I will do anything :P Issues and Pull Requests are welcome, but I deem this module as pretty much feature complete.","title":"DavinciTimestamp"},{"location":"#davincitimestamp","text":"DavinciTimestamp is a PowerShell module that allows you to converts Davinci Resolve EDL files to Timestamps e.g. for YouTube.","title":"DavinciTimestamp"},{"location":"#overview","text":"You can add markers in your Davinci Resolve Timeline - but there is no native way to export these in a YouTube-compatible format.
